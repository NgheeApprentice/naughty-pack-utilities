## Want to enhance your experience with The Jackbox Naughty Pack's content? ...Slightly...?
This mod aims to give users the option to make content generation in Fakin' It All Night Long and Let Me Finish, and restore Dirty Drawful to a maximum player count of ten players, much like Drawful: Animate. So what's new?

# Features:
## Fakin' It All Night Long:
### Allow Content Level Adjacency (setting)
This is a toggle setting that, when set to true, allows content of neighbouring intensities to be rolled. Usually, the Content Level setting will only allow rolling one intensity at a time. Refer to the table below:
| Content Level option | Allowed content intensity |
| --- | --- |
| Nice | NORMIE |
| Normal | SPICY |
| Spicy | XXX |

But with the Allow Content Level Adjacency setting enabled, Content Level 'Nice' can roll 'NORMIE' and 'SPICY' prompts, Content Level 'Spicy' can roll 'SPICY' and 'XXX' prompts, and finally Content Level 'Normal' allows all prompts to be rolled.

## Dirty Drawful
### 'Max Players' raised to 10 players!
This change includes:
- Restored 10 player layouts from most of the game's asset files
- Two all new colour palettes for players nine and ten
- New 10 player layouts for the game's lobby and content creation phase
- One all new toilet pencil animation in the content creation phase (but you can only see it in 9-10 player games, so bring all your friends)
- No new audio for players nine and ten. Ain't nobody messing with a bank file

## Let Me Finish
### Rework of the content generation system!
Prompt naughtiness of images throughout the game will now properly follow the levels defined in the appropriate game skeletons in /json/gamesetups.json
To accomodate the changes made to this system, updates to the Content Level setting were made.

### New options/rework of the Content Level setting!
This allows all previous settings to act in their original, unbugged behaviour, and adds new settings to revert to the bugged behaviour introduced in the content update for The Jackbox Naughty Pack.
| Content Level option | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Less Naughty | General mix of NICE and NAUGHTY prompts. |
| Normal | General mix of NAUGHTY and NASTY prompts, with one NICE prompt in your first game with 'Same Players.' The default behaviour on launch. |
| Nasty | Just NASTY prompts, with one NAUGHTY prompt in your first game with 'Same Players.' |
| Just Nice | Just NICE prompts, original bugged behaviour of Content Level 'Less Naughty' |
| Just Naughty | Just NAUGHTY prompts, original bugged behaviour of Content Level 'Normal' |
| Just Nasty | Just NASTY prompts, original bugged behaviour of Content Level 'Nasty' |

## Installing this mod
As with installing any mod, *it is strongly recommended that you backup any files you plan to replace and/or modify.* Simply backup, and replace all relevant files in your copy of The Jackbox Naughty Pack with the ones in this mod!

### Have fun with more customisability in your content!
